# Non-regression tests

Geogram uses extensive testing. More details [here](https://github.com/BrunoLevy/geogram/wiki/DevOps#tests) on how to run the
tests manually. Tests are run after each commit (`smoke`), and on a regular basis (`nightly` and `weekly`), using github actions.
Test results are published both as artifacts attached to the corresponding actions, and as HTML pages (links below).
